Operators and conditions:
//Swift has operators for doing arithmetic and for comparison; they mostly work like you already know.
//You can use if, else, and else if to run code based on the result of a condition.
//Although you might see it in other code, I wouldn’t recommend using it yourself.
//If you have multiple conditions using the same value, it’s often clearer to use switch instead.
